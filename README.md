# Folklore
This website contains stories and information about the history and meaning of Folklore. Personally, I've always had a large interest in eerie fairytales and would like to share my interest with the internet.
## Intro to Folklore
Folklore is most commonly defined as cultural legends or myths that have been passed down in the form of stories. Many of them have hundreds of variations with their own modern twists. All variations pertain to the same story though.
The root of my personal interest in Folklore is something that I haven't pinpointed yet. But I've realized the eeriness and wickedness draws me in to many early legends and myths. The eloquence of the stories resembles in riddles and Old English.
## My Folktale Reccomendations
### Baba Yaga
One Folklore story that embodies the wicked and twisted feeling I love is the story of Baba Yaga. The story entails a horrid witch whom lives in a dark forest. She lives in a house, but that house has chicken legs and chases those who enter the forest.

###Rumpelstiltskin
Another story that I personally love is one that you may be familiar with. The story of Rumpelstlktsken follows a basic storyline with a wicked little troll facing his consquences. But it is combined with many dark twists and can be enjoyed by all ages. I highly recommend reading the story if you haven't already.

## Extra points
Besides the predictable, but unpredictable plots, and riddle-like writing, Folklore also has a very distinct style of art. It mimics the paintings made back when we still had kings and queens. The art has always added more character and feeling to the stories. Many mythical creatures have sprouted from such stories. Some you may be familiar with are gnomes, goblins, fairies, leprechauns, and so many more.
## Summary
The feeling received from these Fairytales is something I'll never be able to replace. I have been reading these stories since I was a young child and to this day I still want rock stew, which I had read about in an old tale. It's a niche subject but something that I feel as though should be shared to the whole world. So be sure to check out my reccomendations!
