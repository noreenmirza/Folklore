# Folklore
This website contains stories and information about the history and meaning of Folklore. Personally, I've always had a large interest in eerie fairytales and would like to share my interest with the internet.
## Intro to Folklore
Folklore is most commonly defined as cultural legends or myths that have been passed down in the form of stories. Many of them have hundreds of variations with their own modern twists. All variations pertain to the same story, though.
The root of my personal interest in Folklore is something that I haven't pinpointed yet. But I've realized the eeriness and wickedness draws me in to many early ;egends and myths. The elquence of the stories takes in riddles and old englsih.
## Some of my Favorite Stories
One Folklore story that embodies the wicked and twisted feeling I love is the story of Baba Yaga. The story entails a horrid which whom lives in a dark dark forest. She lives in a house, but that house has chicken legs and chases those who enter the forest.
